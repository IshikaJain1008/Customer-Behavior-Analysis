# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Data Analytics End-to-End Project

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.
The goal of the project is to transform raw data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the findings through a clear report and presentation.

**Dataset:**
1.The dataset was loaded and processed using Python.
2.It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis and business reporting.
3.Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats were identified and handled during the cleaning phase.

**Tools & Technologies:**
1.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
2.PostgreSQL – Running analytical SQL queries
3.Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation
4.Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation
5.Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

**Project Steps:**

1.-->Data Loading:
  -Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
  -Performed initial inspection of rows, columns, and data types.
  
2.-->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns.
  - Identified outliers, missing values, and correlations.
  - Created visualizations to support insights.
    
3-->Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  -Handled missing and duplicate records.
  -Corrected data types and standardized values.
4-->Prepared clean data for database storage and visualization.

5-->SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)
  -Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
  -Wrote SQL queries to extract key metrics and insights.
  -Performed aggregations, filtering, and joins.

6-->Dashboard Development (Power BI)
   -Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs and charts.
   -Enabled filtering and drill-down for deeper analysis.
   
7-->Reporting & Presentation
   -Created a structured analytical report summarizing insights.
   -Designed a presentation (PPT) using Gamma for stakeholder communication.

**Dashboard:**
* The Power BI dashboard provides:
* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trend analysis and comparisons
* Interactive filters for dynamic exploration
* The dashboard is designed to be business-focused and easy to interpret.

**Results & Insights:**
1.Identified key trends and patterns within the data.
2.Highlighted actionable insights useful for decision-making.
3.Presented findings in a clear and visually appealing manner through dashboards and reports.

**How to Run the Project:**
1.Clone this repository:
    git clone <repository-url>
2.Install required Python libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3.Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to:
   -Load the dataset
   -Perform EDA and data cleaning
   -Load the cleaned data into PostgreSQL and run the provided SQL queries.
   -Open the Power BI file to view and interact with the dashboard.
4.Review the report and presentation for summarized insights.

**Conclusion:**
--> This project showcases practical skills in data analysis, SQL querying, dashboarding, and storytelling with data.
--> It reflects a real-world analytics workflow and is suitable for demonstrating capabilities to recruiters and hiring managers.
